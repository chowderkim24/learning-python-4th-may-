journey as I learn how to code using python
the following code explains how to set up a number of codes which enable the user to access a weight calculator, a number generator which is able to provide the user with a sequential list of numbers between 1 and 10 depending on the number which the user would like to begin at.
the other number generator provides the user with a sequential list of 11 numbers from whichever point they would like to start at.
the weight calculator is able to convert the weights which the user inputs to either kilos or to pounds. the code for the weight generator has a number of problems currently. however, corrections are pending.
